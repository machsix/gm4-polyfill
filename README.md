This utility is designed to ease authoring user scripts compatible with
both Greasemonkey 4 and other/older user script engines.

It is forked from [https://github.com/greasemonkey/gm4-polyfill](https://github.com/greasemonkey/gm4-polyfill). Modifications are made to make it comptatible with old js syntax as well as script managers like `Adguard`.
